# Linux

While I using Linux and familial with a lot of command or tricks on standard binary tool, It quite clear that I am nowhere near using all of it. This contain command that less for daily used, but more on server handle, troubleshot tools that worth noted

# Notes

`lsof`: I normally use `netstat -tulpn` to check which process take/listenning on specific port. `lsof` can be the interchange tools with even more ultility finding bottleneck.
