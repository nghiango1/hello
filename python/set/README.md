# Set

## Initilization

Python set initilization and define is

```python
s = set()
```

Or directly just like `dict()`, but this need to have some default value. The
REPL will assumming `{}` a `dict()` without any init value provided

```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
```

>>>  a= {}

    a= {}

>>> a = {}
>>> a.add(1)

>>> a = {1}
>>> a.add(1)
>>> a.add(2)
>>> a
{1, 2}
>>> type(a)
<class 'set'>
>>>
```

## Usage

In normal use case, `add` an `remove` is more than enough

```python
s = {1, 2}
s.remove(1)
s.add(3)
```

Some advange useage is `set` intersect or merge

- Merge using `|` operator
- Intersect using `&` operator
- Xor operator can also be use, which as you can expected result which remove
  all collision element of the two `set`

```
>>> a = {1, 2}
>>> b = {2, 3, 4}
>>> a | b
{1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> a & b
{2}
>>> a ^ b
{1, 3, 4}
```
