# Learning Effectively

Learn to process through hard question

1. Read the lesson first!
1. Read the assignment: Understand the goal of the assignment before you start writing code.
1. Start writing code.
1. Add `print` statements. Don't wait until you've written a lot of code to start testing. Add `print` statements and use the `Run` button to see if your code is doing what you expect at each step. It's easier to find issues in small bits of code than in large blocks of code.

   - Keep running, printing, and fixing until you're confident your code is working.

1. Submit your code. If the assignment you're working on has unit tests, no need to remove your debugging `print` statements. If the assignment you're working on is testing console output, be sure to remove your `print` statements before submitting.
1. Compare your code to the instructor's. You will not be penalized for looking at the solution after you have successfully completed the assignment. (I usually skip this. Oh well, I'm not even have access to them anyway)

Temporarily adding print() statements is a good way to...

## Answer

...quickly test and debug small pieces of code

> Add `print` statements and use the `Run` button to see if your code is doing what you expect at each step. It's easier to find issues in small bits of code than in large blocks of code.

Other is wrong as:

- ...submit your code to the grader : We not trying to summit code here, we only want to `Run` the code and make sure every step of my code work as expected
- ...lose some xp : May be the internet point is worth some thing? We don't want to lose them, so the act of add `print` is to make sure we have the correct answer before `Summit` our code. This will further ensuring that we don't lose any XP
- ...get carpal tunnel syndrome : This happend when we code by a lot, make sense when I try to print on every step... Could this be the actual answer? Anyway, it is unrelated to the current material (and newer dev should not know about this yet) so we should skip this one
