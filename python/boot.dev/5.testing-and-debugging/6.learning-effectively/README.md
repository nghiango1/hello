# Learning Effectively

Learn to process through hard question

1. Read the lesson first!
1. Read the assignment: Understand the goal of the assignment before you start writing code.
1. Start writing code.
1. Add `print` statements. Don't wait until you've written a lot of code to start testing. Add `print` statements and use the `Run` button to see if your code is doing what you expect at each step. It's easier to find issues in small bits of code than in large blocks of code.

   - Keep running, printing, and fixing until you're confident your code is working.

1. Submit your code. If the assignment you're working on has unit tests, no need to remove your debugging `print` statements. If the assignment you're working on is testing console output, be sure to remove your `print` statements before submitting.
1. Compare your code to the instructor's. You will not be penalized for looking at the solution after you have successfully completed the assignment. (I usually skip this. Oh well, I'm not even have access to them anyway)

## Quiz

When you're stuck, which should you do first?

## Answer

Ask Boots a question about your code

> Try to use Boots before peeking at the solution. Boots is quite good at giving you pointed hints to help you solve the problem on your own

This one is from `boot.dev`, in actual environment is could mean:

- Asking team member, or PIC of the project
- Asking upper manager, who reposible to help your team
- Google, ChatGPT, Stackover... Oh well, anything to assist you

as the problem you dealling with should be solved already and it help direct you to the correct path when you got stuck with it for too long. Again, these is from `boot.dev` team trying to help your learning process

- Peek at the solution : Cretainly some thing we may want to do, but it should be avoid. Process through hard question is the core for learnning, we shouldn't have the habit of giving up and look through the answer. Boots actually helpping as they only give hint (and have less XP penalty than peeking solution, if you care about them)
- Whine on X (Twitter) about how hard coding is : Done it already, doesn't help
