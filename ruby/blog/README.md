## Deployment instructions

Start the server
```sh
bin/rails server
```

## Next step

Create new routes handler
- Update routes configuration using DSL `./config/routes.rb`
    ```ruby
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
      get "/articles", to: "articles#index"
    ```
- Generate new sites index page
    ```sh
    rails generate controller Articles index --skip-routes
    ```
- Look at `./app/controllers/articles_controller.rb` and `./app/views/articles/index.html.erb` and try to change their content
    ```html
    <h1>Articles#index</h1>
    <p>Hello world</p>
    <p>Find me in app/views/articles/index.html.erb</p>
    ```

- Change roots page of the Web application need update `./config/routes.rb`. Here I use the articles page we just created
    ```ruby
      # Defines the root path route ("/")
      root "articles#index"
    end
    ```

Create new Models (Object that representing real world application target).
- Generate new Models
    ```sh
    rails generate model Article title:string body:text
    ```

- This result in generating theses output (create new files):
    ```
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20241020145009_create_articles.rb
      create    app/models/article.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/article_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/articles.yml
    ```

- Then we update the database to have our Models represent in regional table format
    ```sh
    rails db:migrate
    ```

- We then can use `rails console` to create and interact with this Models directly (instead of using SQL Database or running in-app ruby script)
    ```sh
    rails console
    ```

- Try with these command
    ```ruby
    # Loading development environment (Rails 7.2.1.1)
    article = Article.new(title: "Hello Rails", body: "I am on Rails!")
    article.save
    Article.find(1)
    Article.all
    exit
    ```

- Using the Model into our View (Pages) require "import" them into an variable in `./app/controllers/articles_controller.rb`
    ```ruby
    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @articles = Article.all
      end
    end
    ```

- Then update the page `html.erb` files to use the variable. Here we loop though it
    ```erb

    <p>Lists of created articles</p>
    <ul>
      <% @articles.each do |article| %>
        <li>
          <%= article.title %>
        </li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
    ```

> **`<% %>` and `<%= %>`**: The `<% %>` tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code." The `<%= %>` tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code, and output the value it returns." Anything you could write in a regular Ruby program can go inside these ERB tags, though it's usually best to keep the contents of ERB tags short, for readability.

## Haml - New template engine for Rails

Haml is a markup language that's used to cleanly and simply describe the HTML of any web document without the use of inline code. Haml functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP, ASP, and ERB, the templating language used in most Ruby on Rails applications

Haml can be used in three ways:

- as a command-line tool,
- as a plugin for Ruby on Rails,
- and as a standalone Ruby module.

The first step for all of these is to install the Haml gem:

```sh
gem install haml
```

Then, to use Haml with Rails, add the following line to the `Gemfile`, here I use a specific version:

```rb
# HAML
# gem "haml"
gem "hamlit", "~> 2.15.0"
```

Once itâ€™s installed, all view files with the ".html.haml" extension will be compiled using Haml.

## Bundle - Gemfile update

Referrer: [https://bundler.io/v2.5/man/gemfile.5.html](https://bundler.io/v2.5/man/gemfile.5.html)

There is some change to gemfile, I put some info in here:
- Groups: Each gem MAY specify membership in one or more groups. Any gem that does not specify membership in any group is placed in the default group.
- Require As: Each gem MAY specify files that should be used when autorequiring via Bundler.require. You may pass an array with multiple files or true if the file you want required has the same name as gem or false to prevent any file from being autorequired.

```sh
group :development do
  gem "rubocop"
  gem "solargraph", "~> 0.47.2", require: false # rubocop:todo Gemfile/MissingFeatureCategory

  gem "ruby-lsp", "~> 0.19.0", require: false
  gem "ruby-lsp-rails", "~> 0.3.6"
  gem "ruby-lsp-rspec", "~> 0.1.10", require: false
end
```
