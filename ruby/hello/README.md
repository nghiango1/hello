# Hello

Say less

- `puts`: Each argument is in seperated line, require string type
- `print`: All the argument is flush into one single line`

Can be run by using ruby
```sh
ruby hello.rb
```

These string syntax can make effect:
- `'<string>'` is treat as literal (unless we want to use `'` in that string, which we require to escape it using `\'`)
- `"<string>"` is treat as extended ACSII, which support special character ("\n" for new line, etc)
