# Variable

Some how this is at session [19. Variables](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/variables.html) in Ruby document? That late into it.

The doc already tool about:
- Global: Start with `$`
- Instance: Start with `@`
- Local: Start with lower case ASCII or `_`

And the last
- Constant

So I assumming we need to walk through module/class system first to understand this
