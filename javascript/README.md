# Javascript

A language that should be available by default in every computer with a working browser
- Good to automate the web
- Even better with IDE intergrated inside chromium browser - Window with MS Edge
    - Advanced API for file system access and many other thing

Javascript is the language I can fallback to at any moment when I am not feel like to do a repetitive task. This even more importance as all App at this current time use webui for some reason

## Notes

This sould conatin need to know about javascript to get started

- Install: I worte down some `npm` command to get me going. Neovim isn't the best place to write js code
    > All this just to get LSP working?
- Hello: `console.log('Hello!!')` 10 years JS experience right in my resume now
- Variable: Primitive and Complex type, How to use object
- Sort: Array, Copy array, Sorting array, Binary search. I want to use them daily as a language so might as well put it some where I can easily have reference
