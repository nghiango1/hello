# TestLinkedList

This test the theories that Array List perform better than Linked List.

## Background

Normally I will doing some level of OOP / classic data structure in language by implementing Array List and Linked List. But:
- Re implementing isn't needed, the standand library of `java` will cover almost all possible Data structure know to man (At least any thing that you will ever use in a real job).
- Every thing in java is in a class, which already OOP enough

So I will instead testing this theory which come from the creator of c++ him self [Bjarne Stroustrup: Why you should avoid Linked Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)

```
Array is continous memory, so in specific condition it work better.
The theory is that it almost alway better anyway
