# Builder

I like it

## The problem

You want a DSL (Domain specific language) to create the perfect object but it need to be inside Java OOP syntax

## What this aim for

Java tool chain is really mature, so I want to know what Java development tools/environment give to developer. Better use inlay_hint form neovim nightly or we just better use others IDE

## Implement

I example this pattern by create a easy to use HTMLElementBuilder, while also adding a HTML server along the way to serve that too. It listen on [0.0.0.0:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
