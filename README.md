# hello
Hello is a repo contant a lot of personal notes along with working code helper to help you check if the evironment needed for each language/computer concept is working.

## Why?
Start as a repo where at first I only want to create only Hello world version of each language, but it soon seem not working. The checking for my Pesonal devolopment environment (Vim, DAP, LSP, Tmux, CLI application) require to be test on more advanced project structure, feature, ...; while also expand to more computer sience concept (VM, Containner). Making this not restricted only for simple code.

## Feature
Dedicated note and code for a wide range of language and computer concept. This also is the pace where I save some praticing code algo for academic purposes (Readding book, self taught after school/university)
- pascal: Mostly used in my High school to join Computer sience contest (National, Region Olympic, ...). I do used it to re-read some Algo book from this time.
- c: I like this more and more, even better than c++ (which can be use and teach as an alternative to pascal). My first choice for fundamental concept learning.
- c#
- go
- java
- lua
- node (javascript as backend)
- python
- rust (btw)

Other:
- container

## How to used
Go to each language specific folder and build the code using README.md note
