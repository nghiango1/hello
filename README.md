# hello
Hello is a repo contant a lot of personal notes along with working code helper to help you check if the evironment needed for each language/computer concept is working.

## Why?
Start as a repo where at first I only want to create only Hello world version of each language, but it soon seem not working. The checking for my Pesonal devolopment environment (Vim, DAP, LSP, Tmux, CLI application) require to be test on more advanced project structure, feature, ...; while also expand to more computer sience concept (VM, Containner). Making this not restricted only for simple code.

## Feature
Dedicated note and code for a wide range of language and computer concept. This also is the pace where I save some praticing code algo for academic purposes (Readding book, self taught after school/university)
- pascal: Mostly used in my High school to join Computer sience contest (National, Region Olympic, ...). I do used it to re-read some Algo book from this time.
- c: I like this more and more, even better than c++ (which can be use and teach as an alternative to pascal). My first choice for fundamental concept learning.
- c#: My niche project use c#
- go: I want to focus more in this language, and do believe on this language vision
- java: For actual job
- lua: For neovim config
- node (javascript as backend): I use javascript for web automation and chrome/chromium/edge console as the alway available option for coding/IDE on every computer. So it nature to know a thing or two in it's counter part, which require running javascript on backend 
    > Most linux come with gcc, bash, python though, so you have a lot more option
- python: I use this the most back in university, for CTF (sercurity contest, that focus in breaking unsecured **crypto**graphy implementation), Machine learning (web anomally detection for my graduation thesis, personal interest on next step of programing aumation). And, it still the most comfortable language I want to use daily
- rust: btw

Other:
- container: a low footprint seperated with specific environment (linked library, application) for my low resource pc/laptop. But with KVM it become non-trivial.
> `chroot` should work better in most usecase, I use build container's image to get my secondary root directory

## How to used

Go to each language specific folder and build/follow the `README.md` note
