# hello
Hello is a repo contant a lot of personal notes to install along with working code to help you check if the evironment is properly setuped for various languages, tool and computer concepts.

## Why?
Started with a plan to make a collection of basic "Hello World" code for different programming languages, I soon realized this wasn't enough. To properly test my setup with tools like neovim, DAP, LSP, tmux, and various CLI applications, I needed more advanced projects with complex structures and features. I also decided to include more computer science concepts like virtual machines and containers. So, the repository is not just about simple code; it covers a wider range of topics with personal notes

## Feature
Dedicated note and code for a wide range of language and computer concept. This also is the pace where I save some praticing code algo for academic purposes (Readding book, self taught after school/university)
- `pascal`: Mostly used in my High school to join Computer sience contest (National, Region Olympic, ...). I do used it to re-read some Algo book from this time.
- `c`: I like this more and more, even better than c++ (which can be use and teach as an alternative to pascal). My first choice for fundamental concept learning.
- `c#`: My niche [project](https://github.com/ylsama/RightClickMoveMode) use C#, it seem helped a lot of [people](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2614?tab=posts) too. This is me try to use c# in linux.
- `go`: I want to focus more in this language, and do believe on this language vision. One of my biggest side project writen in go lang is a new interpreter language [InterinGo](https://github.com/nghiango1/hello/tree/main/go/interpreter) which I built an [online site](https://nghiango.asia/) for everyone to check it out
- `java`: For actual job
- `lua`: For neovim config
- `javascript`: I use javascript for web automation and chrome/chromium/edge console as the alway available option for coding/IDE on every computer. 
- `python`: I use this the most back in university, for CTF (sercurity contest, i focus in breaking unsecured **crypto**graphy implementation), Machine learning (web anomally detection for my graduation thesis, personal interest on next step of programing aumation). And, it still the most comfortable language I want to use daily
- `rust`: For joining btw cult

Other:
- `container`: a low footprint seperated with specific environment (linked library, application) for my low resource pc/laptop. But with KVM it become non-trivial.
    > `chroot` should work better in most usecase, I use build container's image to get my secondary root directory
- `nginx`: for sharing my local project over VPN, use as a reverse proxy
- `oracle`: for setup and using oracle database and other oracle product (Oracle Linux, Grid, RAC)
- `linux`: (notes on how to use) various tools for administering a linux system

## How to used

Go to each language specific folder and build/follow the `README.md` note
