I like `c` when it time to know how thing work

## Feature

- `hypervisor/`: How VM acutally work, I don't know, but there is `vmx` thing that support creating a VM on hardware? I'd love to try to make my own VM manage program from eh.. almost nothing

- `ProjectTemplate/`: A `c` hello world project with `Make`, I'd copy this template when I start a new one

- `lrucache/`: Basic data structure

- `search/`: Contain **two crystal ball** problem, which is a special O(sqrt n) problem

- `sort/`: Quicksort (single file, project) and Radixsort (single file) implement

- `structure/`: Creating a structure with some function that directly tie to them in `c`. I like to sample this with List and LinkedList data structure, which is exactly what I did.

- `variable/`: Some indepth thing to know about variable in c (initialling, type casting, ...) with vary language provided data types
