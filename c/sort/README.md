# sort

This leave with two file, containing Radixsort and Quicksort implementation from the book "Giải thuật và lập trình" of "Lê Minh Hoàng" ported to `c` language. It should be identical code with `pascal/sort/`

## Note

Both of them share a similar approarch, where:
- `quicksort.c` use a middle value (as know as pivot) and swap elements
- `radixsort.c` use literal bit value of the data object (which here is a `int` value) and swap elements

> I don't think i have a good graph on Radix sort yet, but it is a book content.
