Goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

# Notes avaialbe

Most of the code come from `golang` documentation, while `pow10_9` is a actual problem to limit testing go rountine

- `hello/`: The introduction of gorountine
- `channel/`: Supported way to communicate between gorountine process
- `tree_sequence/`: A example on how to use channel, gorountine to comparing two tree

- `pow10_9/`: Testing the limit of go rountine, you can't just create infinity thread/process in your computer, here i try to handle 1_000_000_000 * 100 input string.
