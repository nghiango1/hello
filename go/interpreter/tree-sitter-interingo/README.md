## Adding parsers

If you have a parser that is not on the list of supported languages (either as a repository on Github or in a local directory), you can add it manually for use by `nvim-treesitter` as follows:

1. Clone the repository or [create a new project](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#project-setup) in, say, `~/projects/tree-sitter-zimbu`. Make sure that the `tree-sitter-cli` executable is installed and in your path; see <https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#installation> for installation instructions.
2. Run `tree-sitter generate` in this directory (followed by `tree-sitter test` for good measure).
3. Add the following snippet to your `init.lua`:

```lua
local parser_config = require "nvim-treesitter.parsers".get_parser_configs()
parser_config.zimbu = {
  install_info = {
    url = "~/projects/tree-sitter-zimbu", -- local path or git repo
    files = {"src/parser.c"}, -- note that some parsers also require src/scanner.c or src/scanner.cc
    -- optional entries:
    branch = "main", -- default branch in case of git repo if different from master
    generate_requires_npm = false, -- if stand-alone parser without npm dependencies
    requires_generate_from_grammar = false, -- if folder contains pre-generated src/parser.c
  },
  filetype = "zu", -- if filetype does not match the parser name
}
```

If you wish to set a specific parser for a filetype, you should use `vim.treesitter.language.register()`:

```lua
vim.treesitter.language.register('python', 'someft')  -- the someft filetype will use the python parser and queries.
```

Note this requires Nvim v0.9.

4. Start `nvim` and `:TSInstall zimbu`.

You can also skip step 2 and use `:TSInstallFromGrammar zimbu` to install directly from a `grammar.js` in the top-level directory specified by `url`.
Once the parser is installed, you can update it (from the latest revision of the `main` branch if `url` is a Github repository) with `:TSUpdate zimbu`.

Note that neither `:TSInstall` nor `:TSInstallFromGrammar` copy query files from the grammar repository.
If you want your installed grammar to be useful, you must manually [add query files](#adding-queries) to your local nvim-treesitter installation.
Note also that module functionality is only triggered if your language's filetype is correctly identified.
If Neovim does not detect your language's filetype by default, you can use [Neovim's `vim.filetype.add()`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.filetype.add()>) to add a custom detection rule.

If you use a git repository for your parser and want to use a specific version, you can set the `revision` key
in the `install_info` table for you parser config.

## Adding queries

Queries are what `nvim-treesitter` uses to extract information from the syntax tree;
they are located in the `queries/{language}/*` runtime directories (see `:h rtp`),
like the `queries` folder of this plugin, e.g. `queries/{language}/{locals,highlights,textobjects}.scm`.
Other modules may require additional queries such as `folding.scm`. You can find a
list of all supported capture names in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#parser-configurations).

All queries found in the runtime directories will be combined.
By convention, if you want to write a query, use the `queries/` directory,
but if you want to extend a query use the `after/queries/` directory.

If you want to completely override a query, you can use `:h set_query()`.
For example, to override the `injections` queries from `c` with your own:

```lua
require("vim.treesitter.query").set_query("c", "injections", "(comment) @comment")
```

Note: when using `set_query`, all queries in the runtime directories will be ignored.

## Adding modules

If you wish you write your own module, you need to support

- tree-sitter language detection support;
- attaching and detaching to buffers;
- all nvim-treesitter commands.

At the top level, you can use the `define_modules` function to define one or more modules or module groups:

```lua
require'nvim-treesitter'.define_modules {
  my_cool_plugin = {
    attach = function(bufnr, lang)
      -- Do cool stuff here
    end,
    detach = function(bufnr)
      -- Undo cool stuff here
    end,
    is_supported = function(lang)
      -- Check if the language is supported
    end
  }
}
```

with the following properties:

- `module_path` specifies a require path (string) that exports a module with an `attach` and `detach` function. This is not required if the functions are on this definition.
- `enable` determines if the module is enabled by default. This is usually overridden by the user.
- `disable` takes a list of languages that this module is disabled for. This is usually overridden by the user.
- `is_supported` takes a function that takes a language and determines if this module supports that language.
- `attach` takes a function that attaches to a buffer. This is required if `module_path` is not provided.
- `detach` takes a function that detaches from a buffer. This is required if `module_path` is not provided.
